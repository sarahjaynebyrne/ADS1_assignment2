# ADS1 - Assignment 2

TITLE OF PROJECT = The Effects of Human Population Growth on Climate Change in South American Countries.

This assignment was conducted using a dataset from World Bank the website link -> https://data.worldbank.org/topic/climate-change.

I have focused on exploring statistics and trends within a dataset.  Applying PEP-8 guidelines to my code.

The primary aim was to observe the Pearson correlation coefficient between CO2 emissions and Population in South American countries. Additionally, the study visually showed the CO2 emissions from 1960 and 2018.

This project used the following modules:

- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- scipy.stats

This repository contains 3 branches:
1. main branch -> contains the final version of code and PDF A4 pager
2. figures (jpeg format) -> contains the figures the code produces
3. code -> older versions of the code as proof that the code improved overtime
