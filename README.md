# ADS1 - Assignment 2

This branch contains the older versions of the code:

- version 1 is using only 1 dataframe that is all the countries and all the indicators (this was too much to process) so split the data 
- version 2 onwards is using multiple dataframes for manipulation and correlation analysis
- the final version of the code can be found in the branch named 'main'
